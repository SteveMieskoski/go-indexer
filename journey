Diving in to fully learn Go
- Dabbled with GO in the past, but feel like it is time to commit

- In connection with other work I was doing at the time I considered a good learning project would be a blockchain indexer and relay

- Used other's work to get off the ground, and then began to look at structure

- First looked at Kafka, but backtracked based on the overhead of learning two new items together.  Will revisit Kafka later

- Went to mongoDB, as I'm familiar with using it in JS, Python, and Java, so adding GO to the mix felt like a good starting point.
