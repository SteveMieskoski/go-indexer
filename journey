Diving in to fully learn Go
- Dabbled with GO in the past, but feel like it is time to commit

- In connection with other work I was doing at the time I considered a good learning project would be a blockchain indexer and relay

- Used other's work to get off the ground, and then began to look at structure

- First looked at Kafka, but backtracked based on the overhead of learning two new items together.  Will revisit Kafka later

- Went to mongoDB, as I'm familiar with using it in JS, Python, and Java, so adding GO to the mix felt like a good starting point.

- This proved to be accurate and in short order the indexer was retrieving raw chain data from my isolated local ethereum env
and saving blocks, transactions, and transaction receipts in mongo

- The next stage is to transition the ingestion stage to use kafka, and attaching a processor to split the raw chain data
into a query friendly data model

- the implicit type declarations are one feature about Golang that I'm not sure if I like.  it does make coding easier, but
it also feels a little javascriptish in sometimes needing to locate the declaration to check what type is being returned.
